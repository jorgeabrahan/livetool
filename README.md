(Responsive) (CRUD) (Promises) (Modules) (Firebase) Tool for those who stream on Facebook to sell products.

This tool is ment for some people that use Facebook lives to sell some of their products. In order to do this, they have to manually keep a record of the clients they have, the products they sell and the price of each one of it, that way everytime they sell a product during a stream they will write down the name of the person, the amount of products that persona bought, the price of each product, and they also have to add a distinctive to the product so they can remember who that product belongs to. 
This tool keep a virtual record for you, the reason why is better to use this tool than keeping you own record is because: is reliable, is fast, is easy to use and also because is multiplatform, once you are loged in you can acces your notes wherever you are and in the device you have in hand. This tool works only with an account, so if you want one you can ask me for one. 

If you just want to try the app you can use this test data:
